As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","IsLinkSuppressed":"0"},{"Source":"Amazon.com Review","Content":"Readers of epic fantasy series are: (1) patient--they are left in suspense between each volume, (2) persistent--they reread or at least review the previous book(s) when a new installment comes out, (3) strong--these 700-page doorstoppers are \u003cI\u003eheavy\u003c/I\u003e, and (4) mentally agile--they follow a host of characters through a myriad of subplots. In \u003cI\u003eA Game of Thrones\u003c/I\u003e, the first book of a projected six, George R.R. Martin rewards readers with a vividly real world, well-drawn characters, complex but coherent plotting, and beautifully constructed prose, which \u003cI\u003eLocus\u003c/I\u003e called \"well above the norms of the genre.\" \u003cp\u003e  Martin's Seven Kingdoms resemble England during the Wars of the Roses, with the Stark and Lannister families standing in for the Yorks and Lancasters.  The story of these two families and their struggle to control the Iron Throne dominates the foreground; in the background is a huge, ancient wall marking the northern border, beyond which barbarians, ice vampires, and direwolves menace the south as years-long winter advances.  Abroad, a dragon princess lives among horse nomads and dreams of fiery reconquest.\u003cp\u003e  There is much bloodshed, cruelty, and death, but \u003cI\u003eA Game of Thrones\u003c/I\u003e is nevertheless compelling; it garnered a Nebula nomination and won the 1996 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. So, on to \u003cI\u003eA Clash of Kings\u003c/I\u003e!  \u003cI\u003e--Nona Vero\u003c/I\u003e

There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow.

Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House

R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in \u003ci\u003eA Feast for Crows\u003c/i\u003e, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003eA FEAST FOR CROWS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/b\u003eIt seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives.

Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jamie and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister,

Wish you could split a lemon cake with Sansa Stark, scarf down a pork pie with the Night’s Watch, or indulge in honeyfingers with Daenerys Targaryen? George R. R. Martin’s bestselling saga A Song of Ice and Fire and the runaway hit HBO series \u003ci\u003eGame of Thrones \u003c/i\u003eare renowned for bringing Westeros’s sights and sounds to vivid life. But one important ingredient has always been missing: the mouthwatering dishes that form the backdrop of this extraordinary world. Now, fresh out of the series that redefined fantasy, comes the cookbook that may just redefine dinner . . . and lunch, and breakfast. \u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e A passion project from superfans and amateur chefs Chelsea Monroe-Cassel and Sariann Lehrer—and endorsed by George R. R. Martin himself—\u003ci\u003eA Feast of Ice and Fire \u003c/i\u003elovingly replicates a stunning range of cuisines from across the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. From the sumptuous delicacies enjoyed in the halls of power at King’s Landing, to the warm and smoky comfort foods of the frozen North, to the rich, exotic fare of the mysterious lands east of Westeros, there’s a flavor for every palate, and a treat for every chef.\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e These easy-to-follow recipes have been refined for modern cooking techniques, but adventurous eaters can also attempt the authentic medieval meals that inspired them. The authors have also suggested substitutions for some of the more fantastical ingredients, so you won’t have to stock your kitchen with camel, live doves, or dragon eggs to create meals fit for a king (or a \u003ci\u003ekhaleesi\u003c/i\u003e). In all, \u003ci\u003eA Feast of Ice and Fire\u003c/i\u003e contains more than 100 recipes, divided by region:\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• The Wall: \u003c/b\u003eRack of Lamb and Herbs; Pork Pie; Mutton in Onion-Ale Broth; Mulled Wine; Pease Porridge\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• The North: \u003c/b\u003eBeef and Bacon Pie; Honeyed Chicken; Aurochs with Roasted Leeks; Baked Apples\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• The South: \u003c/b\u003eCream Swans; Trout Wrapped in Bacon; Stewed Rabbit; Sister’s Stew; Blueberry Tarts\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• King’s Landing: \u003c/b\u003eLemon Cakes; Quails Drowned in Butter; Almond Crusted Trout; Bowls of Brown; Iced Milk with Honey\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• Dorne: \u003c/b\u003eStuffed Grape Leaves; Duck with Lemons; Chickpea Paste\u003cbr\u003e \u003cb\u003e• Across the Narrow Sea: \u003c/b\u003eBiscuits and Bacon; Tyroshi Honeyfingers; Wintercakes; Honey-Spiced Locusts\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e There’s even a guide to dining and entertaining in the style of the Seven Kingdoms. Exhaustively researched and reverently detailed, accompanied by passages from all five books in the series and full-color photographs guaranteed to whet your appetite, this is the companion to the blockbuster phenomenon that millions of stomachs have been growling for. And remember, winter is coming—so don’t be afraid to put on a few pounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb\u003e Includes a Foreword by George R. R.
